# Phase 1 — External Analysis (No Teardown)

## 1. Keyboard Identification
- Manufacturer:
- Model:
- Layout:
- Connection (wired/wireless/hybrid):
- Hot-swap vs soldered:
- Firmware/software (VIA/QMK/proprietary):
- Source links (product page/manual):

## 2. Physical Observations (Assembled)
- Top view notes:
- Bottom view notes:
- Side/profile notes:
- Weight/rigidity impressions:
- Any visible screws/clips/feet/labels:

## 3. Switch + Key System (Best Guess)
- Switch type (brand/model if known):
- Mount style (plate/PCB/unknown):
- Stabilizers (Cherry/Costar/unknown):
- Keycaps (material/profile/shine-through?):

## 4. Hypotheses Before Teardown
- Expected row/column estimate:
- Where the controller likely is (and why):
- Diodes: likely yes/no (and why):
- RGB: per-key vs zones (and why):

## 5. Marketing Claims → Engineering Meaning
Pick 3 claims and translate them.
1) Claim:
   - What it implies:
   - Likely tradeoff/cost-cutting:
2) Claim:
   - What it implies:
   - Likely tradeoff/cost-cutting:
3) Claim:
   - What it implies:
   - Likely tradeoff/cost-cutting:

## 6. Assumptions I Expect to Be Wrong
- Assumption 1:
- Assumption 2 (optional):
